Description: Genome level Trellis graph visualizes genomic data conditioned by 
    genomic categories (e.g. chromosomes). For each genomic category, multiple 
    dimensional data which are represented as tracks describe different features 
    from different aspects. This package provides high flexibility to arrange
    genomic categories and to add self-defined graphics in the plot.
