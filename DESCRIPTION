Description: Genome level Trellis graph visualizes genomic data conditioned by 
    genomic categories (e.g. chromosomes). For each genomic category, multiple 
	dimensional data which are represented as tracks describe different features 
	from different aspects. This package provides high flexibility to arrange
	genomic categories and add self-defined graphics in the plot.
